  abstract={Intravenous (IV) catheterization is a common procedure. Still, there is a 26% chance of the first attempt catheterization failure due to the changing visibility of veins because of the patient's skin tone and body fat content. Ultrasound assistive devices help locate deeper veins but are not practical in emergencies, and transillumination assistive devices have a low field of view. Commercial near-infrared (NIR) imaging devices are effective in vein localization but are expensive and are not used in low-cost clinical settings. To overcome this, NIR Multispectral Imaging (MSI) was used to find the optimal wavelength that provides the enhanced visualization of veins for all skin types and Body Mass Index (BMI). The band with the highest vein-to-skin contrast ratio was selected and contrast enhancement was done using our proposed method. The primary blocks of the proposed method are Gamma correction, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Adaptive Thresholding, and image Fusion. The optimal spectral range was found to be 814-876 nm and our method increased the contrast by 0.41, 0.375, and 0.39 for fair, brown, and dark brown skin types, respectively, with different BMI.},

  abstract={In imaging spectroscopy, gathering oral tissue spectral data from resected samples may not accurately represent tissue signatures due to time-dependent changes, blood loss, protein degeneration, and preservation chemicals. In-vivo spectral imaging is employed to address these limitations, but it poses challenges like device dimensions, tissue accessibility, and motion artifacts, impacting data quality and reliability. Our study publishes a dataset of spectral images focusing on oral diseases, addressing these challenges. We used a state-of-the-art multispectral camera, capturing images at 270*510 pixels resolution in 16 spectral bands (460 nm to 600 nm). The dataset includes 91 participants (15 healthy and 76 diseased), with multiple images per patient, totalling 243 spectral images. The dataset encompasses three oral health conditions: Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF), Leukoplakia, and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Detailed patient history records accompany each case. This publicly available oral health multispectral dataset has the potential to advance spectroscopy diagnosis. Integrating artificial intelligence with a comprehensive spectral signature repository holds promise for accurate disease analysis.},

  abstract={Vein localization is crucial for successful cannulation, but it can be challenging due to factors such as skin colour and Body Mass Index (BMI). While near-infrared (NIR) imaging is established for improving vein visibility, the optimal wavelength for patients with varying skin colours and BMIs has not been thoroughly studied. Thus, it is important to explore optimal wavelength selection to address these influencing factors. In this study, we developed and tested a method for enhancing vein contrast using Multispectral NIR imaging and evaluated the impact of skin colour and BMI on vein visibility in a sample of 61 subjects. Our study found that the optimal wavelength for vein visibility in the NIR region was 864 nm, and the proposed method effectively enhanced vein contrast. We also found that skin colour and BMI influenced vein visibility, with fair skin and lower BMI associated with better vein visibility. Our study demonstrates the potential of NIR imaging for enhancing vein visibility, and also emphasizes in considering skin colour and BMI as significant factors. However, there were some limitations of our study, as the majority of the age group consisted of the young population and it was not inclusive of babies and elderly people for whom venous access is difficult.},

  abstract={The timely detection of gastrointestinal cancer (GI) is crucial for effective treatment, and endoscopy plays a crucial role in visualising the internal organs for abnormalities. Despite its utility, detecting polyps or early-stage cancer remains a challenge due to their subtle nature, often requiring subjective assessment by experienced clinicians. The introduction of Blue-Light Imaging (BLI) has emerged as a promising solution, accentuating structural tissues and abnormal growths. It uses the principle of light-tissue interaction to enhance the visualisation of the surface microvessels to localise the cancer. However, there are no quantitative studies that suggest a ratio of White:Blue light for visualising these structures with high contrast. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate different ratios of White:Blue light intensity that can be used for enhanced endoscopic examinations. A gastroscope equipped with BLI technology was engineered, and experiments were carried out to assess the qualitative and quantitative performance of the images taken with different White:Blue light ratios. The system design, in vivo validation on the lower lip mucosa, and in vivo feasibility via pilot human study assessments are discussed. Analysis of our results suggests that mixing White:Blue in the ratio of 1:1 to 4:1 can provide a well-illuminated and high-contrast image. The findings from this study can help design and develop newer BLI systems to improve cancer diagnostics.},
